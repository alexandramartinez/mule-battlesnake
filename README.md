## Quickstart

To get started with your own Mule and DataWeave Battlesnake, please refer to Manik's [starter project](https://github.com/manikmagar/mule-battlesnake-starter) or [this article](https://www.prostdev.com/post/how-to-develop-a-battlesnake-using-a-mulesoft-api-and-the-dataweave-language).

You can battle Maxine by using her from the public snakes when you [create a game](https://play.battlesnake.com/account/games/create).
